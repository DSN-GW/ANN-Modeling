# V3 Neural Network Model Results: Autism Spectrum Disorder Classification

## Model Architecture and Performance Overview

Our V3 system employs a sophisticated four-stage pipeline for ASD classification: (1) stratified data preprocessing, (2) dual-path feature extraction, (3) XGBoost classification, and (4) SHAP explainability analysis. The model processes 51 features across two complementary domains: 22 characteristic-based features using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for behavioral analysis, and 29 comprehensive NLP features capturing linguistic patterns.
